# Setup your project
So let's start with making our lives easier. @Bol.com we are used to create new JavaScript packages once in a while that can be shared along various projects. As part of the bol.com workflow we are therefore used to create packages that are nice to work with. Not only for ourselves but for our colleagues as well.

## Exercise
With that in mind we should be able to guarentee quality, maintainability and scalability. Which translates into an exercise where you will setup:
* JavaScript test suite of choice
* Type safety (Flow, Typescript, PropTypes)
* Static code analysis (Eslint)
* Precommit hook that peforms the checks above on staged files

**Note:** For linting it is allowed to use preconfigured packages. Please explain why you choose a certain setup. And keep accessibility (a11y) and React in mind.

Bonus
* Code formatting (Prettier)

Approximate time to finish: **1.5 hours.**
